<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This projects facilitates the implementation of Self-Sovereign Identity solution. Self-Sovereign Identity refers to a
decentralized model where individuals have control over their digital identities and can manage their personal data
securely and autonomously. It is developed within the [Tractus-X project](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/) under the umbrella of the Eclipse Foundation,

The Eclipse Foundation provides a neutral environment and governance structure for various
projects, enabling individuals and organizations to contribute and build upon each other's work.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation

To install and use this lib , you have two options: building from source or using the pre-built package from Maven Central Repository.

### Build from Source

To build the project from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/catenax-ng/product-lab-ssi.git 
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd cx-ssi-lib 
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. After a successful build, you can include the generated JAR file in your project's dependencies.

### Use Maven Dependency

Alternatively, you can use the pre-built package available on Maven Central Repository by adding the following Maven dependency to your project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.tractusx.ssi</groupId>
  <artifactId>cx-ssi-agent-lib</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

Make sure to update the version number if a newer version is available.

Once you've added the dependency, your build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle) will automatically download the library and include it in your project.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
# Roadmap

Our roadmap for future development includes the following key milestones:

1. **Enhanced DID Management**: We plan to further enhance the DID management functionality by adding support for additional DID methods and advanced features such as Using new methods for DID resolution and DID document updates.

2. **Extended Cryptographic Operations**: We aim to expand the cryptographic operations offered by the library, including support for more signing algorithms, advanced key management features.

3. **Credential Ecosystem**: We will focus on improving the credential management capabilities, including support for different credential formats, revocation mechanisms, and interoperability with existing credential ecosystems such as Verifiable Credentials.

4. **Standard Compliance**: We are committed to ensuring compliance with emerging SSI-related standards and specifications. We will continuously update the project to align with evolving standards and ensure compatibility with other SSI tools and platforms.

5. **Performance Optimization**: We will invest in optimizing the performance of the library, aiming to reduce computational overhead, improve efficiency, and provide better scalability for large-scale SSI agent deployments.

6. **Comprehensive Documentation and Tutorials**: We will continue to improve the project's documentation, providing comprehensive guides, examples, and tutorials to assist developers in effectively utilizing the library's features and integrating it into their SSI agent projects.

Please note that the roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback, emerging standards, and the evolving needs of the SSI ecosystem. We welcome contributions and suggestions from the community to help shape the future direction of the project.
